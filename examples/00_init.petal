// This is the entrypoint for every Petal application.
//
// Each application must have a `main` function that returns an `i32`. This is a 32-bit integer that indicates the
// process' exit code.
//
// In this example, we return `0`. Running the program in the Petal VM should exit with a zero status code.
// 
// TIP: In Bash, you can use `echo $?` to print the exit code of the previous command.
func main() -> i32 {
    return 0;
